    <p class="text-lg sm:text-md md:text-lg lg:text-lg xl:text-xl py-1">Wish Diner is an upcoming furry visual novel, a side project mainly worked on by two members of the Stray Project, NekoPanda and Rakki. It has themes of wish-granting in similar vein as "The Monkey's Paw" (however a monkey is not expected to appear in this one). Work on the project is currently in the script-writing phase and more info will be provided as it becomes available.</p>
