## Requirements
- [node](https://nodejs.org) and npm (installed when you install node)
### Additional Requirements for Recommended Setup
- [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the tailwindcss extension (install in extensions)

## Recommended Setup
- install node, then open a terminal inside the project terminal (using vs code: terminal > new terminal) and run `bundle` to install dependencies from the Gemfile. this step only needs to be done once per device.
- to start a live preview in your browser, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. every time you edit and save any file in the project folder it'll update the view.
- to publish, commit your edits and wait a minute.
