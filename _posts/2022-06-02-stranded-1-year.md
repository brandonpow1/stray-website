On this day one year ago, June 2nd, 2021, the remake of the visual novel Stranded was released on itch.io. Today marks its first anniversary. Let's look back at some past images.

### Stranded-0
Actually this story starts a little bit before that date: before October 2020, Nekopanda already created a visual novel with the same name, titled Stranded (from here on out referred to as Stranded-0) with his own artwork. Screenshots showed three characters including a bear and two doggos. I think.

            <img class="rounded-lg" src="/assets/img/posts/old1.webp">
            <p class="text-center py-0">Grumpy fellow</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img class="rounded-lg" src="/assets/img/posts/old2.webp">
            <p class="text-center py-0">The gang</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I don't know much about it since I never got access to the original files, I'll update this post accordingly if I get more info.

### Flunky's art takeover
Near the end of October 2020, the artist Flunky (then called Flunky Wolf) agreed to collaborate with Nekopanda and produced some sprite designs. Over the next few months, more art would be produced by him.

### Demo - Prologue
![](/assets/img/posts/olddemoscreen.jpg)
June 24th, 2021 was the date that the visual novel with Flunky's assets was made publicly available. This demo only included the prologue of the game up until the plane crash and had five characters displayed on the main menu. However, they did not actually make an appearance in the game until the release of Chapter 1 in November 2021.

### Release of Chapter 1
For some reason, the release of chapter 1 on November 26th, 2021 was marked on itch.io as a "first build release". Huh. Anyways this included the five characters in a script, and we are introduced to Kim, Beru, Terry, Lucy and Owen.

Many aspects of Stranded-0's script carry over to Stranded. Look at these two comparisons:
<div class="container mx-auto not-prose" markdown="0">
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
        <div>
            <img class="rounded-lg" src="/assets/img/posts/wakeupold.webp">
            <p class="text-center py-0">Old</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img class="rounded-lg" src="/assets/img/posts/wakeupnew.webp">
            <p class="text-center py-0">New</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
Though the art is different, the text stays the same.

## What's Next?
Well, let's look at the past visually:

The space between one chapter seems to be about 4 months; however if the team were to adhere to this schedule chapter 2 should've been released by April 2022. (Oops.) We're still working hard on it though! Art for chapter 2 is being drawn and we look forward to bringing you the rest of this game soon.
