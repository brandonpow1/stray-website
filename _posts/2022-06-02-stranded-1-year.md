On this day one year ago, June 2nd, 2021, the remake of the visual novel Stranded was released on itch.io. Today marks its first anniversary. Let's look back at some past images.

### Stranded-0
Actually this story starts a little bit before that date: some time in October of 2020, Nekopanda already created a visual novel with the same name, titled Stranded (from here on out referred to as Stranded 0) with his own artwork.

### Flunky's art takeover
Near the end of October 2020, the artist Flunky (then called Flunky Wolf) agreed to collaborate with Nekopanda and produced some sprite designs. Over the next few months, more art would be produced, until finally a demo was released.

Look at these two comparisons:

Quite the difference, wouldn't you say?
