Stranded v0.1.2.2 has been released! You may download it from our [download page](/stranded.html).

## Changes
* The audio folder has been rearranged internally to help with the [web port's](/strandedweb.html) loading times: music and longer background sound effects will now be streamed from itch.io and not bundled into the initial game.zip download. While this means a requirement for a more persistent internet connection, the initial download size is reduced by about 25MB which is substantial! (Also the cache size in the browser becomes smaller.)
* Support for Simplified and Traditional Chinese has been added! Thanks to our translator, "泡澡的inko" who offered his translation strings.

Sadly there aren't any story updates in this one; the game up to chapter 1 is still about 7k words long as it was before. Regardless, we're still working on it! Please be patient!
